          <ul class="serious experience-items">
            <li><span class="em">Technical lead</span> on Content Sharing, Automation Builder, Invoices & Quotes, and Reporting teams for small business CRM software.</li>
            <li>Member of <span class="em">frontend leadership team</span>, which decided on the direction of the site's frontend technologies and platform.</li>
            <li>Transitioned frontend code to using a monorepo full of smaller, independent sections, rather than a bloated monolith.</li>
            <li><span class="em">Lead front-end developer</span> on site rebranding.</li>
            <li>Set up analytics and messaging software (Drift, Intercom, Amplitude, Salesforce messaging) for web and mobile apps.</li>
            <li>Lead biweekly department-wide software demos, and frequent presenter at quarterly company meetings.</li>
            <li>First woman Staff-level engineer at the company.</li>
            <li>Built a number of award-winning internal tools during quarterly hackathons: connecting mentors, organizing teams, keeping track of hackathon projects, and maintaining feature flags across multiple environments.</li>
          </ul>
          <ul class="silly experience-items">
            <li>Larger company with about 120 people in Product Development, split across ~16 teams</li>
            <li>This was the first time I worked as a <span class="em">tech lead</span>. It was rare for the lead of a team to be a frontend developer, so I think that says a lot about my personality and leadership qualities.</li>
            <li>Working with <span class="em">React Native</span> for mobile apps is the best! I'm glad we jumped on that wagon early.</li>
            <li>I gave special emphasis on working with <span class="em">remote employees</span> pre-pandemic, and making them feel included on
              a team by involving them in discussions, participating in team builders, and making sure everyone in the
              department understood and empathized with the best ways to communicate with them.</li>
            <li>In addition to <span class="em">leading PD demo meetings</span>, I was also on the tailgate committee that
              organized quarterly company team builders, the team that organized hackathons, the Diversity & Inclusion
              team, founder of the promotion process support group, and organizer of weekly PD happy hours. I bring the fun!</li>

            <li><span class="em">Lead front-end developer</span> in Scottsdale office of multinational company.</li>
            <li>Built single-page <span class="em">jQuery</span> and <span class="em">ReactJS</span> web applications for health information in a fully agile development environment.</li>
            <li>Presented <span class="em">Git, React, ES6,</span> and <span class="em">Gulp/browserify</span> webtooling brownbag sessions for instructing new hires.</li>
            <li><span class="em">Winner</span> of hackathon project competition, which displayed recent health-related tweets on SVG maps.</li>
          </ul>
          <ul class="silly experience-items">
            <li>Small-ish team of about 15 devs/QA</li>
            <li>I was basically the only frontend dev there lol</li>
            <li>We did mainly ReactJS apps, with <span class="em">Redux</span> thrown in for sanity. There's some <span class="em">jQuery</span> but lots of people think it's old and busted :/. These apps need a robust framework to work off, though, because they're huge.</li>
            <li>Content: health information, big data, really fast queries (in <span class="em">elasticsearch</span>) to narrow down the patient population to what you want to see.</li>
            <li>I did a lot of talks on some n00b stuff like <span class="em">Git</span>, which I love, and I want everyone else to love it too (and use just command line plz). I also am drinking the <span class="em">ES6</span> koolaid because it is SUPER AWESOME and at this point can't believe that we ever didn't have it natively on browsers, or had to resort to using <span class="em">babel</span> to get it to work. <span class="em">Gulp</span> and <span class="em">browserify</span> were also really useful at the time; we really needed them to coordinate the building of our million node libraries, but thankfully that's not really necessary anymore. Webpack ftw.</li>
            <li>I learned SO MUCH STUFF here, mainly <span class="em">React</span> and how new technologies are COOL and it's great when your work environment lets you use them.</li>
            <li>However, being the only frontend person on a team is way less cool, and I work better in a group I can bounce ideas off of.</li>

            <li>Transformed UX and design specifications into high-quality <span class="em">HTML/CSS/JS</span>.</li>

            <li>Transformed scriplet-ridden <span class="em">JSP pages</span> into clean MVC approach.</li>
            <li>Participated in interview process of hiring new web developers.</li>
          </ul>
          <ul class="silly experience-items">
            <li>Pretty <span class="em">large team</span> of about 60 devs; 6-8 who did mainly frontend</li>
            <li>The site was going through a rebrand, and I built a lot of the really well-traveled pages during that, like the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.homeadvisor.com">home page</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.homeadvisor.com/cost">Cost Guide</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.homeadvisor.com/profinder/">ProFinder</a>. Also the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.homeadvisor.com/login">"My Account"</a> pages and important stuff like the submit path.</li>
            <li>"Building" basically meant a <span class="em">total redesign</span> of everything; there were scriplets everywhere and they needed to get pulled out and replaced.</li>
            <li>We went mainly with the servlet <span class="em">MVC</span> approach, but on some pages we got to do AJAX calls to rest APIs, which were fun.</li>
            <li>My favorite part was taking PSDs from the design department and translating that into HTML/CSS. I like the <span class="em">attention to detail</span> that it requires.</li>
            <li>I did a fun internal image crowdsourcing project, which was based on one that I'd made during one of our "free time" days. They said it saved the company what would have been about <span class="em">$3 million</span> in stock image fees.</li>
            <li>I really loved this job!!</li>
