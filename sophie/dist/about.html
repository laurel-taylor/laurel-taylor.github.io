  <h1>About Sophie's Universe</h1>
  <p>Sophie's Universe is the name of a crochet project that was made by  Dedri Uys of <a href="https://lookatwhatimade.net">https://lookatwhatimade.net</a>, and was the CAL (crochet-along) project of 2015.</p>
  <p><a href="https://lookatwhatimade.net/crafts/yarn/crochet/sophies-universe-cal-2015/sophies-universe-cal-2015-information/">Please check out her site for all the information about the project!</a></p>
  <p>The crochet pattern is FREE and there is SO MUCH helpful information on the site. Luckily, Dedri kept track of the amount of yarn used for each round and I threw that data into this project.</p>

  <h2>About the calculator</h2>
  <p>I made this calculator to make it easier to get an idea of what it will look like when you choose your own colors, and purchase the right amount of yarn to make Sophie. </p>
  <p><strong>Obviously, your milage </strong>(meterage?) <strong>may vary.</strong></p>
  <p>When you press the "calculate skeins" button it will show you how many balls you will need, given the meterage of your skeins. Green means you'll probably be good, red means you might want to up your # of balls (or play a nice game of yarn chicken).</p>

  <p>You can also export & copy/paste your chosen yarn colors after calculating your meterage, or export a shopping list for how many balls of each color you'll need.</p>
  <p>The default yarn color names are Scheepjes brand, and were the ones used in Dedri's original projects, but this calculator makes it possible to mix and match patterns, colors, and sizes.</p>

  <p>Recommended defaults:</p>
  <ul>
      <li>Small -> small pattern -> Scheepjes Color 8</li>
      <li>Medium -> medium pattern -> Scheepjes Softfun</li>
      <li>Medium -> medium pattern 2 -> Scheepjes Colour Crafter</li>
      <li>Large -> large pattern -> Scheepjes Softfun XLr</li>
  </ul>

  <p>You can find links for where to buy the recommended yarn on <a href="https://lookatwhatimade.net/crafts/yarn/crochet/sophies-universe-cal-2015/sophies-universe-cal-2015-information/">her site</a>!</p>
