  <h1>About Laurel</h1>

  <p>Laurel is a pretty cool guy, she knows HTML and doesn't afraid of anything. /sentences that show your age</p>

  <p>Welcome to my site, where I dump all my fun javascript side-projects. They're mainly karaoke, video game, or BTS related.</p>

  <p>This site uses a bunch of <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">bootstrap</a> and <a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>, because I like those things. Yes I still like jQuery. I'm waiting for its popularity to circle back around, and then you'll see. You'll all see!</p>

  <p>I also like using <a href="http://vuejs.org">Vue</a>, because it's better.</p>

  <p>My resum√© is <a href="./resume/index.html">here</a>, if you're into that kind of thing.</p>

  <p>I've got some stuff on jsFiddle <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/user/laurel-taylor/fiddles/">here</a>.

  <p>All the contents and code of this site is open source and can be found, stolen, and used for good and/or nefarious purposes <a href="https://github.com/laurel-taylor/laurel-taylor.github.io">here on github</a>. You might have guessed that by the URL of this page.</p>
