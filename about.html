  <h1>About Laurel</h1>
  <p>Laurel is a pretty cool guy, she knows HTML and doesn't afraid of anything.</p>
  <p>This site uses a bunch of <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">bootstrap</a> and <a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>, because I like those things. Yes I still like jQuery. I'm waiting for its popularity to circle back around, and then you'll see. You'll all see!</p>
  <p>My resum√© is <a href="./resume/index.html">here</a>, if you're into that kind of thing.</p>
  <p>I've got some stuff on jsFiddle (what? it's convenient) <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/user/lbrugg/fiddles/">here</a>.
  <p>All the contents and code of this site is open source and can be found, stolen, and used for good and/or nefarious purposes <a href="https://github.com/lbrugg/lbrugg.github.io">here on github</a>. You might have guessed that by the URL of this page.</p>
